# Car detection for Autonomous Driving

This project is a machine learning model that detects cars in images and videos for use in autonomous driving systems. The model is trained on a large dataset of annotated car images and is able to accurately identify cars in new images and videos.

Getting Started
To use this model, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

NumPy
OpenCV
TensorFlow

Once you have the required libraries, you can download the model and use it to detect cars in images and videos. The model is provided as a TensorFlow SavedModel, which can be loaded using the tf.saved_model.load function.

# Model Performance
The model has been trained on a dataset of annotated car images and has achieved high accuracy on the test set. It is able to detect cars in a variety of lighting conditions and from different angles.

# Limitations
While the model is able to detect cars with high accuracy, it is not perfect and may sometimes fail to detect cars or mistakenly detect non-car objects as cars. It is important to use the model as part of a larger system that includes additional sensors and logic to handle these cases.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:

Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
Write tests to ensure that the model is working as expected.
Document any changes or additions to the model.
